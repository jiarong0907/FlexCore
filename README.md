## FlexCore

Today's programmable switches are only programmable at compile time. Once the program is deployed, the switch becomes "fixed". To change the switch function, we must recompile and flash the switch pipeline, which creates a lot of disruption.
FlexCore is an ecosystem for runtime programmability. It supports live program upgrades on switches with strong consistency guarantees and no downtime.

The ecosystem of FlexCore includes:
- A switch hardware design for live program upgrades
- Partial reconfiguration primitives to change P4 elements at runtime
- A version control mechanism to achieve transactional changes
- Multi-step transaction consistency algorithms.

More details can be found here:
[FlexCore (NSDI'22)](https://jxing.me/pdf/flexcore-nsdi22.pdf).


This repo serves as a tutorial on the system. It provides the setup for the BMv2-based implementation and examples for the test.




## Setup

FlexCore includes two parts: 1) the software to process inputs and computes the reconfiguration plans with different consistency guarantees; and 2) the software switch implemented based on BMv2.

The first part is included in this repo, which just requires the regular Python3 environment. The second part is separately maintained in another repo, [runtime-programmable-switch](https://github.com/jiarong0907/runtime-programmable-switch). Please follow the instructions in the runtime-programmable-switch repo to set up the software switches. **You can simply get a pre-configured environment by downloading our VM image** ([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqOxmJthd4h_TK8V9VHYGSFerzjjnTKz/view?usp=sharing)).



## Input

FlexCore supports three types of inputs. The first one can be accepted to deployed into the software switch, while the other two are mainly used to test the software algorithms.

### P4 Json files as inputs
Provides two json files compiled by `p4c` to the system: one is from the old P4 program; the other is from the new P4 program. FlexCore will transform them into an IR and computes the differences. According to the specified consistency level, these differences will be transformed into reconfiguration primitives, which can be used as inputs for the software switch.

The parameters are shown as the following:
```
$ python3 main.py -h
usage: main.py [-h] -p {exec,elem,prog} -b {graph,json,obj} -old OLD_PATH -new
               NEW_PATH -out OUT_PATH

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -p {exec,elem,prog}  The choice of planner
  -b {graph,json,obj}  The choice of input builder
  -old OLD_PATH        The path of the old json/graph/obj
  -new NEW_PATH        The path of the new json/graph/obj
  -out OUT_PATH        The path to save generated commands
```

Example input:
```
python3 main.py -p prog -b json -old ../examples/firewall/firewall_old.json -new ../examples/firewall/firewall_new.json -out ./
```

### Plaintext graph files as inputs
This is used to test the software algorithm. Inputs are manully written graphs.

Example input:
```
python3 main.py -p prog -b graph -old ../examples/test1/test1_old.txt -new ../examples/test1/test1_new.txt -out ./
```


### Synthetic graph objects as inputs
This is used to test the software algorithm. Inputs are synthetic IR graphs.

The synthetic IR graphs are generated by our synthesizer tool. There are two ways to use it:
1. Use a json file compiled by `p4c` as the initial old program and randomly generate the modified new program with random edits. For example,
```
python3 ./ast_based_synthetic.py -o ../examples/netcache_modified/netcache -j ../examples/netcache/netcache_input/netcache.json -ip 50 -it 50 -is 2 -e 4 -at 20 -ac 0 -r 75 -rc 2 -es 2
```
2. Randomly synthesize the initial old program and randomly generate the modified new program with random edits on the old one. For example,
```
python3 ./ast_based_synthetic.py -o ../examples/synthesized_test1/synthesized_test1 -ip 50 -it 50 -is 2 -e 4 -at 20 -ac 0 -r 75 -rc 2 -es 2
```

For more details on the arguments of the tool, please see the help message.

Then, the output of the synthesizer can be used as the input of the FlexCore algorithm.

Example inputs:
```
python3 main.py -p prog -b obj -old ../examples/netcache_modified/netcache_old.graph -new ../examples/netcache_modified/netcache_new.graph -out ./
python3 main.py -p prog -b obj -old ../examples/synthesized_test1/synthesized_test1_old.graph -new ../examples/synthesized_test1/synthesized_test1_new.graph -out ./
```

## Deploy into the software switch

The output of our algorithm is the plan file for runtime reconfiguration from the old program to the new one. If both programs' json files are ready, you can run them in the software switch.
